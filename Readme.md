# Description

Beginning of February 2019: we are now learning ajax (Asynchronous JAvaScript + XML). This exercise represents a simple fetch from an [api](https://thatsthespir.it/api) on the [That's the spirit website](https://thatsthespir.it/) to generate a random quote on our own website.

# Technologies used

- ajax
- some HTML and CSS

# Progress

Due to time constraints, the site has not been styled yet. CSS to be added to make it look nice.
